# Markdown Notes - Scripts to generate PDFs

I like writing notes. And I like [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Coming from [Synology NoteStation](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/note_station) and tried out stuff like [Joplin](https://joplin.cozic.net/), [Turtle](https://turtlapp.com/), [Laverna](https://laverna.cc) I'm was a little disappointed everytime. As [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and other closed source provider for taking notes are no option for me, this repo was initiated.
